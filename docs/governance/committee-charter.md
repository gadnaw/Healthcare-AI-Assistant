## 1. Legal Authority and Foundation

### 1.1 Charter Purpose and Legal Basis

This charter establishes the Governance Committee for the Healthcare AI Assistant clinical decision support system, defining its authority, responsibilities, composition, and operating procedures. The committee derives its authority from organizational bylaws, applicable healthcare regulations, and delegation from the Board of Directors. This charter provides the legal foundation for all committee activities, ensuring that committee actions carry appropriate organizational authority and that committee members understand the scope and limits of their authority.

The committee operates under the umbrella of organizational corporate governance while addressing the unique requirements of AI-assisted clinical decision-making. Healthcare organizations bear fiduciary responsibilities for patient care quality and safety, and this committee serves as the mechanism through which the organization discharges those responsibilities regarding AI technology. The committee's authority extends to all organizational activities involving the Healthcare AI Assistant, including deployment decisions, usage policies, incident review, and performance monitoring.

Legal authority for this committee derives from multiple sources. Organizational authority flows from the Board of Directors through executive leadership to committee structure. Regulatory authority derives from healthcare regulations requiring quality oversight and patient safety mechanisms. Professional authority derives from clinical licensure requirements and professional standards governing medical decision-making. The committee exercises this combined authority to ensure that AI-assisted clinical decisions meet all applicable legal, regulatory, and professional requirements.

### 1.2 Relationship to Organizational Governance

The Governance Committee operates as a standing committee of organizational governance structure, reporting to the Board of Directors or designated board committee with healthcare oversight responsibility. This reporting relationship ensures that board-level governance maintains appropriate oversight of AI-assisted clinical activities while enabling operational efficiency through committee delegation. The committee provides regular reports to the governing body, keeping leadership informed of AI system performance, incidents, and governance activities.

Executive leadership maintains operational authority for AI system management, with the committee providing oversight and policy guidance rather than direct operational management. This separation ensures that committee members maintain independent judgment free from operational pressures, while executive leadership retains flexibility to manage system operations effectively. The committee interacts with operational leadership through regular reporting, policy recommendations, and consultation on significant matters.

Quality and patient safety committees within organizational structure coordinate with the Governance Committee regarding AI-assisted clinical activities. The Governance Committee addresses AI-specific considerations while aligning with broader organizational quality and safety frameworks. This coordination ensures that AI governance integrates with rather than duplicates organizational quality infrastructure, creating coherent oversight across all clinical activities.

The appointment process ensures thorough vetting of qualifications, conflict of interest assessment, and fit evaluation before formal appointment.

Succession planning ensures committee continuity as member terms expire. The committee maintains a succession pipeline identifying qualified candidates for each role, with regular assessment of pipeline depth and development needs. Succession planning begins twelve months before anticipated vacancy, providing adequate time for candidate identification, qualification verification, and transition planning. The Chair maintains primary responsibility for succession planning, coordinating with organizational leadership and committee members.

Role transitions between committee members require structured handover ensuring knowledge transfer and role continuity. Departing members provide comprehensive briefing to successors, covering ongoing matters, established precedents, and institutional knowledge accumulated during their tenure. Transition periods of at least one month enable overlapping service, with departing members available for consultation during successor's initial period. This structured transition ensures that role vacancies do not create knowledge gaps or operational disruptions.

### 2.3 Member Responsibilities

All voting members bear responsibility to prepare adequately for committee meetings, reviewing distributed materials before deliberation and formulating informed perspectives on agenda items. Members participate constructively in discussions, contributing expertise while remaining open to perspectives from other members. Members vote according to their independent judgment, neither deferring inappropriately to other members nor voting based on external pressures. Members maintain confidentiality of sensitive discussions and emerging organizational information disclosed in committee sessions.

The Chair bears additional responsibilities including meeting agenda development, meeting facilitation, committee representation to leadership and external parties, and coordination with organizational functions regarding committee activities. The Chair ensures that meetings proceed efficiently while allowing adequate deliberation, that all members have opportunity to contribute, and that decisions receive appropriate documentation. The Chair also serves as primary interface with organizational leadership regarding AI governance matters.

The Clinical Lead bears responsibility for clinical assessment of AI system behavior, identifying clinical implications of system performance and usage patterns. The Clinical Lead reviews clinical incident reports, assesses system clinical accuracy, and provides clinical perspective on policy recommendations. The Clinical Lead also serves as primary clinical liaison between the committee and clinical staff using the AI system.

The Patient Representative also helps communicate committee decisions to patient communities.

## 3. Meeting Procedures and Documentation

### 3.1 Quorum and Voting Requirements

Quorum, the minimum number of members required to conduct official business, consists of four of five voting members. This quorum requirement ensures that decisions reflect collective judgment of most committee members while enabling decisions when one member is unavailable. Proxy voting does not substitute for member attendance; all members entitled to vote must be present to cast votes. Members unable to attend may provide written input for consideration, but such input does not substitute for presence and participation in deliberation.

Voting on ordinary matters requires simple majority of members present, with the Chair breaking tie votes when committee members divide equally. Voting on significant matters including policy changes affecting committee authority, system deployment decisions, and recommendations requiring substantial organizational resources requires two-thirds majority, reflecting the heightened significance of such decisions. Voting on constitutional changes affecting committee structure or fundamental authority requires unanimous approval.

Voting occurs through explicit verbal or written indication, with the Chair clearly stating the matter under consideration and soliciting votes from each member in turn. The Chair summarizes the vote outcome, noting any dissenting views. Dissenting members may request that their dissent be recorded in meeting minutes, ensuring that minority perspectives receive documentation. All votes require documentation including the matter under consideration, vote outcome, and any noted dissent.

### 3.2 Meeting Documentation Requirements

Meeting minutes document all official committee actions, providing permanent record of deliberations and decisions. Minutes include meeting date, time, and location; members present and absent; agenda items discussed; decisions made with vote outcomes; action items assigned with responsible parties and deadlines; and any dissenting views requested for recordation. Minutes prepare within five business days following each meeting and distribute to all committee members for review and approval.

Approved minutes archive permanently in organizational compliance records, providing audit trail of committee activities. Archived minutes remain accessible for regulatory review, historical reference, and organizational learning. Minutes require storage in compliance with record retention requirements applicable to governance documentation, typically six years or longer depending on applicable regulations. Electronic storage with appropriate access controls satisfies retention requirements while enabling efficient retrieval.

Meeting materials including agendas, supporting documents, and draft policies distribute to all committee members at least five business days before regular meetings. This advance distribution enables adequate preparation, informed deliberation, and thoughtful contribution to discussions. Emergency meetings may proceed with shorter notice when circumstances require, but materials should distribute as soon as practicable. Meeting material retention follows the same requirements as meeting minutes.

### 3.3 Meeting Frequency and Structure

Regular meetings occur monthly at a consistent date and time determined by the committee, providing predictable schedule enabling member planning and preparation. Regular meetings follow consistent structure including call to order and attendance confirmation, approval of previous meeting minutes, standing reports (Chair, Clinical Lead, Compliance Officer), old business review, new business introduction and deliberation, and meeting adjournment. This structured approach ensures consistent handling of recurring matters while providing flexibility for emerging issues.

Special meetings may convene when circumstances require committee attention before the next regular meeting. Special meetings require at least 48 hours notice to all voting members, with notice specifying meeting purpose and agenda. Special meetings may only address matters specified in the notice, preventing unexpected items from receiving inadequate deliberation. The Chair may convene special meetings in emergencies with shorter notice, but emergency meetings should be limited to genuinely urgent matters.

Annual meeting occurs annually for purposes including committee self-assessment, policy review, and strategic planning. The annual meeting includes comprehensive review of committee activities over the preceding year, assessment of governance effectiveness, review and update of this charter, and committee development planning. The annual meeting may combine with a regular monthly meeting or convene separately as circumstances warrant.

## 4. Conflict of Interest Management

### 4.1 Disclosure Requirements

All committee members must disclose potential conflicts of interest upon appointment and annually thereafter. Disclosure includes financial interests in organizations providing AI technology, consulting relationships with competitors or partners, professional relationships affecting independent judgment, and personal or family relationships with individuals affected by committee decisions. Disclosure obligations continue for two years following committee service termination, covering matters addressed during the disclosure period.

The Compliance Officer maintains conflict of interest disclosures in confidential files, accessible to committee Chair and organizational compliance function. Disclosures review annually and update as circumstances change. Members must promptly disclose conflicts arising between annual disclosures, recognizing that circumstances may change unexpectedly. Failure to disclose known conflicts constitutes grounds for committee removal.

Disclosure alone does not resolve conflicts; appropriate management measures apply based on disclosure assessment. The Chair, in consultation with the Compliance Officer, determines management measures for disclosed conflicts. Measures range from simple disclosure with continued participation to recusal from specific discussions or decisions to complete resignation from committee service. The committee documents conflict management measures in meeting minutes.

### 4.2 Recusal Procedures

Members must recuse themselves from deliberations and decisions when conflicts prevent independent judgment. Recusal applies when members have financial interest in outcome, personal or professional relationships affecting impartiality, or other circumstances creating appearance of impropriety. Members themselves determine recusal necessity, with the Chair available for consultation when uncertainty exists. The Chair may require recusal when member conflict is apparent even if member does not voluntarily recuse.

Recusal requires member absence from relevant discussion and abstention from relevant vote. Meeting minutes document recusal, noting the matter and the recusing member without requiring explanation of conflict details. Recused members remain present for other meeting business, preventing exclusion from all participation. Recusal does not imply wrongdoing; appropriate recusal demonstrates commitment to decision integrity.

Organizational policy prohibits retaliation against members who appropriately recuse themselves. Members who believe they have experienced retaliation for appropriate recusal may raise concerns with organizational leadership or compliance function. The committee examines patterns of apparent retaliation, investigating circumstances and taking appropriate action when retaliation is confirmed.

### 4.3 Ongoing Integrity Maintenance

Beyond formal conflict of interest requirements, all members maintain commitment to committee integrity through appropriate behavior throughout their service. Members do not accept gifts, favors, or preferential treatment from parties with interests before the committee. Members do not use committee position for personal or professional advantage beyond the scope of committee authority. Members maintain appropriate confidentiality regarding sensitive committee discussions and organizational information.

The committee periodically assesses its integrity practices, identifying vulnerabilities and implementing appropriate safeguards. Assessment considers patterns that might indicate integrity concerns, even if individual actions do not constitute formal conflicts. The committee implements preventive measures when vulnerabilities are identified, demonstrating proactive commitment to integrity.

Members who observe behavior inconsistent with integrity requirements may raise concerns through appropriate channels. Concerns may be raised with the Chair, directly with organizational compliance, or through anonymous reporting mechanisms if available. The committee investigates concerns thoroughly, taking appropriate action when investigation confirms integrity violations.

## 5. Decision Authority and Delegation

### 5.1 Committee Decision Authority

The Governance Committee holds authority to establish policies governing AI-assisted clinical decisions, to review and approve AI system deployment decisions, to establish usage guidelines for clinical staff, to review and respond to adverse events involving the AI system, to monitor AI system performance against established benchmarks, and to recommend system modifications based on oversight findings. This authority encompasses both establishment of new policies and modification of existing organizational practices affecting AI-assisted care.

Committee authority extends to organizational functions but not to individual clinical decisions. The committee establishes frameworks within which clinicians exercise judgment regarding specific patient care decisions, but the committee does not direct care for individual patients. This boundary preserves appropriate clinical autonomy while enabling governance oversight. The committee respects the clinical judgment of treating providers while ensuring that frameworks support appropriate AI usage.

Committee decisions bind organizational functions within their scope. Organizational leadership implements committee policies through operational procedures, training programs, and system configurations. Deviations from committee policies require committee approval, preventing operational convenience from undermining governance effectiveness. The committee may delegate implementation details to operational functions while retaining policy authority.

### 5.2 Delegation and Coordination

The committee may delegate specific functions to subcommittees, working groups, or organizational functions while retaining ultimate authority. Subcommittees may address specialized matters requiring focused attention, such as clinical accuracy review, regulatory compliance assessment, or ethics analysis. Subcommittee recommendations require committee approval before becoming effective, ensuring that delegated work informs rather than substitutes for committee judgment.

Operational functions implement committee decisions while coordinating with the committee regarding implementation challenges and operational implications. The Chief Medical Officer, Chief Information Officer, and other executive functions maintain ongoing communication with the committee regarding AI system operations. This coordination ensures that committee decisions account for operational realities while operational activities remain consistent with committee direction.

The committee coordinates with other organizational governance functions including quality and patient safety committees, institutional review boards, and compliance committees. Coordination prevents duplication, ensures coherent governance approach, and addresses overlapping concerns through appropriate governance mechanisms. The Chair maintains primary responsibility for coordination, establishing relationships with parallel governance functions and ensuring effective information sharing.

## 6. Accountability and Reporting

### 6.1 Reporting Requirements

The committee provides regular reports to organizational leadership regarding AI governance activities. Monthly reports summarize committee actions, AI system performance metrics, and any concerns requiring leadership attention. Quarterly reports provide more comprehensive assessment including trend analysis, emerging issues, and recommendations for leadership consideration. Annual reports summarize year-long activities, assess governance effectiveness, and recommend governance improvements.

Reports to regulatory bodies occur as required by applicable regulations. The Compliance Officer coordinates regulatory reporting, ensuring that required reports submit on time and contain accurate information. Regulatory reports may include adverse event reports, compliance documentation, and response to regulatory inquiries. The committee reviews all significant regulatory communications before submission.

Board-level reporting ensures that governing body maintains appropriate oversight of AI governance. The Chair or designated committee member presents regular reports to the board or designated board committee. Board reports focus on strategic and governance matters rather than operational details, ensuring that board attention addresses appropriate oversight level. The board may request additional reporting on matters of concern.

### 6.2 Accountability Mechanisms

The committee is accountable to organizational leadership and governing body for effective AI governance. Accountability manifests through regular reporting, responsiveness to concerns raised, and demonstration of governance effectiveness. The committee demonstrates effectiveness through evidence of improved AI system performance, appropriate incident response, compliance maintenance, and continuous governance improvement.

Committee member accountability includes attendance at meetings, preparation for deliberations, constructive participation in discussions, and commitment to committee work. Members who consistently fail to meet accountability expectations may be counseled by the Chair, with continued failure potentially resulting in recommendation for committee removal. Removal authority rests with the appointing body, with committee recommendation providing input to removal decisions.

The committee as a whole is accountable for governance outcomes. When AI system performance degrades, adverse events occur, or compliance gaps emerge, the committee examines its own oversight effectiveness and governance practices. This self-examination identifies improvement opportunities and demonstrates organizational commitment to governance accountability. The committee reports self-assessment findings to leadership as part of regular reporting.

## 7. Charter Review and Amendment

### 7.1 Charter Review Cycle

This charter receives comprehensive review annually, coinciding with the committee's annual meeting. Review examines charter effectiveness, continued alignment with organizational needs and regulatory requirements, and adequacy of governance provisions. Charter review may result in charter continuation without modification, charter modification addressing identified gaps or changes, or charter retirement if circumstances no longer warrant committee continuation.

Annual review includes assessment of whether charter provisions have operated as intended. The committee examines whether quorum and voting provisions have enabled effective decision-making, whether conflict of interest provisions have maintained integrity, whether documentation provisions have created adequate records, and whether delegation provisions have balanced committee authority with operational efficiency. Identified gaps inform charter modifications.

Charter review also considers whether charter provisions remain current with regulatory requirements and governance best practices. Healthcare AI governance evolves rapidly, with new requirements and best practices emerging regularly. The committee monitors governance developments, incorporating relevant changes into charter review. This proactive approach ensures that organizational governance remains current with evolving expectations.

### 7.2 Amendment Procedures

Charter amendments require supermajority approval of all voting members, reflecting the significance of charter modifications. Amendment proposals may originate from any voting member, from organizational leadership, or from regulatory requirements. All amendment proposals require deliberation period allowing full committee consideration before voting. Amendment proposals motivated by regulatory requirements may receive expedited consideration when circumstances warrant.

Amendment proposals distribute to all voting members at least two weeks before scheduled deliberation, enabling adequate review and consultation. Deliberation occurs at a regular or special meeting, with discussion addressing amendment purpose, implications, and alternatives. Voting occurs after deliberation concludes, with amendments adopted upon supermajority approval. Approved amendments take effect upon approval or at specified effective date.

Emergency amendments may bypass standard amendment procedures when circumstances require immediate charter modification. Emergency amendments require unanimous approval of all voting members and Chair certification of emergency circumstances. Emergency amendments remain effective for ninety days, after which standard amendment procedures must complete for the amendment to remain in effect. This provision enables rapid response to genuine emergencies while ensuring that emergency measures receive eventual thorough review.
