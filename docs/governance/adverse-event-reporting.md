## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose of Adverse Event Reporting

The adverse event reporting system serves multiple organizational purposes fundamental to safe AI-assisted clinical care. The system enables rapid identification and response to situations where AI system behavior affects patient care, preventing minor issues from escalating into significant harm and ensuring that significant events receive appropriate organizational attention. Rapid identification depends on comprehensive reporting by clinical staff who observe AI system behavior in real-world clinical settings.

The reporting system supports quality improvement by aggregating individual events into pattern analysis enabling systematic identification of AI system limitations, training needs, and improvement opportunities. Individual events may appear isolated, but aggregate analysis often reveals systematic issues requiring organizational response. The reporting system provides the data foundation for this analysis, transforming individual observations into organizational learning.

Regulatory compliance requires documented adverse event handling processes and evidence of consistent implementation. Healthcare regulations including HIPAA breach notification requirements, FDA adverse event reporting requirements, and accreditation standards require systematic adverse event management. These procedures establish compliant processes while ensuring that regulatory requirements inform operational practice.

### 1.2 Scope of Adverse Event Reporting

These procedures apply to all adverse events and near-misses involving the Healthcare AI Assistant clinical decision support system. Scope encompasses events where AI system behavior influenced or nearly influenced clinical decisions, events where AI system behavior affected patient care processes, events involving AI system failures or errors regardless of clinical impact, and near-miss events where AI recommendations would have caused harm if followed.

The scope extends to potential events where AI system behavior might have affected care even if actual impact is uncertain. When uncertainty exists regarding event significance, reporting requirements still apply. Quality and compliance functions determine event classification and appropriate response, not reporting clinicians. This expansive scope ensures comprehensive safety monitoring while preventing significant events from escaping organizational attention.

Organizational boundaries for these procedures include all clinical staff using the Healthcare AI Assistant regardless of employment arrangement. Employees, contractors, temporary staff, and credentialed independent practitioners all fall within procedural scope. Events involving any of these categories of personnel require reporting and handling according to these procedures.

### 1.3 Relationship to Existing Reporting Systems

The AI-assisted adverse event reporting system operates alongside existing organizational incident reporting systems while addressing AI-specific considerations. Events meeting criteria for both general incident reporting and AI-assisted adverse event reporting require reporting through both systems. Dual reporting ensures that AI-specific and general incident processes both receive necessary information.

Integration with existing quality and safety reporting structures ensures that AI-assisted adverse events receive appropriate organizational attention. Quality and safety committees receive regular reports on AI-assisted adverse events alongside other safety concerns. This integration ensures that AI safety receives equivalent attention to other patient safety concerns.

Compliance and regulatory reporting functions coordinate with adverse event handling to ensure appropriate external reporting. HIPAA breach reporting, FDA adverse event reporting, and accreditation-mandated reporting all require coordination with adverse event handling processes. The procedures establish coordination mechanisms ensuring consistent and timely external reporting.

## 2. Adverse Event Classification System

### 2.1 Classification Framework Overview

The adverse event classification system categorizes events by severity level, determining required response intensity, escalation pathways, and documentation requirements. Four severity levels recognize the range from actual patient harm requiring intensive response through low-severity events warranting aggregate review. Classification occurs immediately upon event identification and may change as investigation reveals additional information.

Classification criteria balance clinical impact assessment with potential for future harm. Events causing actual patient harm receive critical or high classification regardless of preventability. Events with potential for harm but no actual harm receive classification based on likelihood and potential severity. Events with neither actual nor potential harm may still warrant low-severity classification for trend analysis.

Classification consistency requires clear criteria and trained classifiers. Initial classification by reporting clinicians receives review and confirmation by quality assurance and compliance functions. Classification disputes escalate to governance committee review. Consistent classification ensures appropriate response allocation and meaningful aggregate analysis.

### 2.2 Critical Severity Classification

Critical severity classification applies to adverse events where AI system behavior caused, contributed to, or nearly caused patient harm. Harm includes physical injury, psychological harm, delayed diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, medication errors, and other negative patient outcomes. Critical classification warrants immediate organizational response including executive notification, regulatory assessment, and intensive investigation.

Critical classification triggers regardless of whether actual harm occurred. Near-miss events where AI recommendations would have caused harm but were caught in time receive critical classification if the potential harm was significant. This prospective classification ensures that close calls receive intensive investigation preventing future actual harm.

Examples of critical severity events include AI recommendation that directly caused inappropriate treatment causing patient harm, AI recommendation that should have been caught by clinician but was not, AI system failure providing dangerous recommendations that were followed, and near-miss events where AI recommendation would have caused serious harm if followed. These examples illustrate the threshold for critical classification based on actual or potential significant harm.

### 2.3 High Severity Classification

High severity classification applies to adverse events where AI system behavior created significant risk even though no actual harm occurred. High-severity events warrant prompt investigation and response, though not the immediate intensive response required for critical events. The distinction between high and critical classification depends on whether actual harm occurred, not on potential for harm.

High-severity events include AI recommendations that were clearly inappropriate but not dangerous, AI system behavior that suggested emerging technical issues, clinician confusion regarding AI recommendations leading to workflow disruption, and events where AI recommendations conflicted with patient-specific factors requiring significant clinical effort to resolve. These events create risk and warrant response but lack the harm or near-harm threshold for critical classification.

High-severity events require escalation within 24 hours and investigation beginning within 24 hours. Investigation completion timelines are accelerated compared to medium-severity events. Findings inform rapid system modification or usage restriction as appropriate. High-severity event trends trigger governance committee attention.

### 2.4 Medium Severity Classification

Medium severity classification applies to adverse events where AI system behavior deviated from expected performance without creating significant patient risk. Medium events warrant systematic review through governance processes but do not require accelerated investigation or executive notification. The distinction from high severity depends on risk assessment, not deviation magnitude.

Medium-severity events include AI recommendations that were suboptimal but clinically acceptable, AI system behavior causing minor workflow disruption, clinician override of AI recommendations without significant time investment, and AI recommendations requiring verification effort without clinical risk. These events fall within acceptable operating parameters while still warranting documentation and review.

Medium-severity events receive weekly aggregate review by governance committee. Investigation occurs as time permits, prioritizing higher-severity matters. Patterns across medium-severity events inform system improvement priorities. Individual medium events do not require separate investigation unless patterns emerge.

### 2.5 Low Severity Classification

Low severity classification applies to events where AI system behavior deviated from optimal but created no patient risk and minimal disruption. Low events warrant documentation for trend analysis but do not require individual investigation or escalation. Aggregate review identifies patterns potentially indicating system issues.

Low-severity events include minor AI system response delays, AI recommendations requiring clarification that was easily obtained, cosmetic issues with AI interface or output, and AI recommendations that were not clinically relevant but not harmful. These events fall within normal operating variation and require only documentation.

Low-severity events receive monthly aggregate reporting. Investigation occurs only when patterns emerge warranting attention. Low-severity event documentation contributes to overall system performance assessment without imposing disproportionate reporting burden.

### 2.6 Classification Decision Matrix

| Severity | Harm Occurred | Risk Level | Response Timeline | Escalation | Investigation Priority |
|----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Critical | Yes/Near-Miss | High | Immediate | CMO, Legal, Compliance within 1 hour | Immediate, dedicated |
| High | No | Significant | Within 24 hours | Clinical Lead within 4 hours | Accelerated, 48-hour completion |
| Medium | No | Moderate | Weekly review | Committee within 7 days | Standard, with other matters |
| Low | No | Low | Monthly aggregate | None | Only if patterns emerge |

## 3. Immediate Response and Escalation Procedures

### 3.1 Immediate Response Requirements

All adverse events require immediate clinical response to protect patients from ongoing harm. Clinical response takes precedence over reporting and documentation requirements. Clinicians must ensure that patients receive appropriate clinical care regardless of AI system involvement. Immediate response may include discontinuing harmful treatments initiated based on AI recommendations, providing appropriate treatments that AI recommendations delayed, notifying appropriate supervisors and colleagues regarding the event, and documenting the event as completely as possible given clinical demands.

Clinical response requirements apply regardless of event severity classification. Even low-severity events may require immediate clinical response if AI system behavior affects patient care. Classification occurs after immediate response, not before. Clinicians should not delay clinical response to determine event classification.

Escalation during immediate response follows established clinical escalation pathways. Supervisors, department leaders, and on-call physicians receive notification based on event characteristics. Critical and high-severity events require additional escalation beyond clinical response. Communication systems ensure that appropriate personnel receive timely notification.

### 3.2 Critical Severity Escalation Protocol

Critical severity events require immediate multi-functional escalation. Within one hour of event identification, escalation includes notification to Chief Medical Officer or designee, notification to Chief Compliance Officer or designee, notification to General Counsel or legal designee, and initial assessment of regulatory reporting requirements.

CMO notification ensures executive clinical leadership awareness and enables resource mobilization for intensive response. CMO involvement may include direct clinical consultation, coordination with clinical departments, and communication with clinical staff. CMO notification occurs regardless of event time, including nights, weekends, and holidays through on-call systems.

Compliance notification enables immediate assessment of regulatory reporting requirements. HIPAA breach assessment begins immediately for events involving potential PHI exposure. FDA adverse event reporting requirements receive assessment. Documentation of compliance assessment protects organizational interests and ensures regulatory compliance.

Legal notification enables assessment of legal implications including patient communication requirements, documentation preservation, and potential litigation exposure. Legal counsel guidance informs response decisions. Documentation preservation occurs immediately upon legal notification.

### 3.3 High Severity Escalation Protocol

High severity events require escalation within four hours to Clinical Lead and Compliance Officer. Escalation includes event description and preliminary severity classification, initial clinical response taken, immediate patient impact assessment, and preliminary investigation plan.

Clinical Lead involvement enables clinical expertise in event assessment and response. Clinical Lead may consult with clinical departments, review clinical documentation, and assess system implications. Clinical Lead escalation occurs during business hours; after-hours escalation to on-call clinical leadership.

Compliance escalation enables regulatory assessment within appropriate timeframes. Compliance assessment determines whether regulatory reporting requirements apply and timelines for any required reporting. Compliance documentation of assessment protects organizational interests.

### 3.4 Medium and Low Severity Escalation Protocol

Medium severity events require escalation within seven days through governance committee reporting structures. Documentation occurs immediately upon event identification, with escalation following after immediate clinical response. Committee review occurs at next scheduled meeting or through urgent review if circumstances warrant.

Low severity events require documentation for monthly aggregate review. Individual low events do not require separate escalation. Aggregate review identifies patterns warranting additional attention.

### 3.5 Communication During Escalation

Effective escalation communication ensures appropriate response coordination. Communication includes event summary with known facts, severity classification and rationale, immediate actions taken, anticipated investigation needs, and required response decisions.

Communication channels correspond to severity level. Critical events use immediate notification systems including phone calls, text messages, and page systems. High-severity events use expedited email and communication systems. Medium and low events use standard reporting systems.

Escalation communication maintains appropriate confidentiality. Patient information protected during escalation communication. Communications labeled with appropriate confidentiality designations. Communication systems comply with privacy requirements.

### 4.4 Medium and Low Severity Investigation Procedures

Medium severity events receive investigation as part of weekly governance committee review. Investigation may include evidence review, pattern analysis across similar events, and identification of system improvement opportunities. Individual investigation occurs only if patterns or severity warrant.

Low severity events receive investigation only when patterns emerge suggesting systematic issues. Monthly aggregate review identifies patterns warranting investigation. Aggregate investigation addresses multiple events collectively, identifying common causes and improvement opportunities.

Investigation documentation for medium and low events includes aggregate findings across events reviewed, identified patterns or trends, recommended system improvements, and any individual events requiring separate attention.

### 4.5 Root Cause Analysis Methodology

Root cause analysis employs systematic methodology ensuring thorough event understanding. Analysis moves from immediate causes through contributing factors to underlying system vulnerabilities. Multiple analytical perspectives ensure comprehensive understanding.

Root cause categories include AI system technical factors including training data limitations, algorithmic issues, and integration problems; clinical workflow factors including workload pressures, communication patterns, and training gaps; organizational factors including policy gaps, resource constraints, and competing priorities; and external factors including patient-specific circumstances and rare clinical situations.

Root cause analysis findings inform corrective action development. Corrective actions address underlying causes rather than surface symptoms. Effectiveness measures verify that corrective actions achieve intended effects.

### 4.6 Documentation Requirements

Investigation documentation includes all evidence collected, interview notes and summaries, analytical frameworks applied, findings and conclusions, corrective actions recommended, and supporting documentation. Documentation must be sufficiently detailed to support regulatory review and legal defensibility.

Documentation standards vary by severity level. Critical events require comprehensive documentation suitable for regulatory submission and legal review. High-severity events require detailed documentation supporting corrective action implementation. Medium and low events require documentation supporting aggregate analysis.

Documentation retention follows records retention policies and regulatory requirements. Investigation records retain for minimum periods specified by regulations. Documentation storage systems ensure security and appropriate access controls.

---

## 5. Corrective Action Implementation

### 5.1 Corrective Action Development

Corrective action development follows investigation findings, addressing identified causes and contributing factors. Corrective actions target root causes rather than symptoms, ensuring that addressing immediate issues does not leave underlying vulnerabilities. Corrective action development involves stakeholders affected by proposed actions.

Corrective action categories include system modifications addressing AI system technical issues, policy clarifications or developments addressing governance gaps, training updates addressing knowledge or skill gaps, workflow modifications addressing process vulnerabilities, and communication improvements addressing information sharing gaps.

Corrective action design considers feasibility, effectiveness, and potential unintended consequences. Actions must be implementable within organizational constraints. Actions must demonstrably address identified causes. Actions must not create new problems while addressing existing ones.

### 5.2 Critical Event Corrective Actions
